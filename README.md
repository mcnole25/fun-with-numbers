# Introduction
Experimenting with big lists of numbers. Everything is in the "files" folder.

This repository was made for fun; the amount of items in each list range from 10,000 to 100,000.

# Non-Lists

### HTML File: all-numbers.html

This is my notation for writing rational numbers (positive & negative), where we have integers, decimals, fractions, & mixed fractions.

You can browse through the infinitely many pages, but the table updates every 500ms to avoid excessive lag.

In page 0, we have the "Special Numbers". 0 is a rational number included to complete the set.

Note: The 2 entries: √2, -√2, are both IRRATIONAL. They cannot be written as fractions, but I treat the square roots of 2 as special constants, so they're included in my notation.

Full set: (All Rationals (Q)) Union (All Real Square Roots of 2)

The list is guaranteed to include every rational number. My code goes through all possible sums of a given input, keeps only the simplified fractions, then converts to decimal or a mixed fraction if necessary.

You can download this file or view it online to start browsing through all the numbers.

### HTML File: console-tools.html

I made a big tool composed of smaller tools! Now you can have fun with the Javascript console by generating lists of numbers.

You can download this file or view it online to start browsing through all the tools.

### HTML File: 100-functions.html

A comprehensive list of all known math operations & functions. Most of them originate form Desmos, but some I added in the "Miscellaneous Functions" section, to make the count 100.

For any functions you don't understand, you can refer to their definitions online.

Version history:

19 May 2025 - Development of this tool begins.

v20250525 - Initial release.

v20250526 - Fixed spelling errors, polished some descriptions & functions.
