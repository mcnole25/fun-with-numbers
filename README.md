# Introduction
Experimenting with big lists of numbers. Everything is in the "files" folder.

This repository was made for fun; the amount of items in each list range from 10000 to 100000.

BUT now this repo is being INVADED BY HTML FILES & MORE CREATIVITY, because I'm just like that ðŸ¤£

# Non-Lists

### HTML File: arithmetic-generator.html

This is an arithmetic generator to calculate all possibilities of manipulating the rational numbers.

You can also choose to filter for integers or for no negative numbers too!

VERY IMPORTANT: If there are ANY wrong or unsimplified answers displayed, no matter how minor, PLEASE LET ME KNOW IMMEDIATELY!

### HTML File: cube-animation.html

A simple cube animation with trigonometry values.

### HTML File: console-tools.html

I made a big tool composed of smaller tools! Now you can have fun with the Javascript console by generating lists of numbers.

You can download this file or view it online to start browsing through all the tools. There are more than 40 to select.

Version history:

19 May 2025 - Development of this tool begins.

v20250525 - Initial release.

v20250526 - Fixed spelling errors, polished some descriptions & functions.

v20250611 - Added new "Number Properties Lister" tool.

v20250615 - Updated the "Partitions" to be more general, added new "2 Team Combinations".

v20250617 - New features: Expression generator v2, Quadratic generator.

v20250702 - New feature: Auto team count decider.

v20250704 - Polished the team count decider feature a little bit.

### HTML File: all-notation.html

A comprehensive list of most known math operations & functions. Most of them originate from Desmos & other sources.

There are 288 pieces of notation to explore. For any functions you don't understand, you can refer to their definitions online.

### HTML File: 52-factorial.html

This is a new tool I created to manipulate, perform operations & shuffle permutations of 52 items.

The number 52 was chosen, because it's inspired by the 52 deck of cards.

The number of possible permutations is `80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000`, which is a very large, but finite number!

### HTML File: factorial-calculator.html

This is a small, very fast infinite precision factorial calculator. All you do is input a number & press the Calculate button. Uses BigInt for calculations.

On my 2025 Windows 10 desktop, computing 50000 factorial takes about 5 seconds.
